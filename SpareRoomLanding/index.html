          The aim of my project was to develop a user-friendly web application which allows homeowners to advertise their spare bedrooms to students seeking term time accommodation. Both students and homeowners are able to create user accounts as either a student or a homeowner. All users are able to create a profile with some information about themselves. Homeowners are able to advertise a room and students are able to search for a spare room to rent. There is a map view to allow students to determine if the location is suitable for their needs.
